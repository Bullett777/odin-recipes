            <li>1 Stick of Butter (8 tbsp)</li>
            <li>All Purpose Flower</li>
            <li>2 Egg Yolks</li>
            <li>Catupiry cheese</li>
            <li> Mexican Crema</li>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol style=" width:540px;">
            <h3>The Beef</h3>
            <li>Clean and trin the meat (you'll want to make sure they are about  1-1/2" thick</li>
            <li>Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder till evenly coated. (This is a dry brine) let it sit for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>You'll want to cook them to an internal temp of 120 degrees.</li>
            <li>Once to temp, take it off the grill and chop it up. (save the bone)</li>
            <li>You will then add the chopped pieces of steak and catupiry cheese into a large mixing bowl and combine.</li>
            <li>In the bowl add chives, salt and black pepper to the meat and chees mixture, combione thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Next you'll want to roll out some saran wrap. Add about half of the mixture in a small rounded area and stick the bone straight up in the middle.</li>
            <li>Roll the mixture around the bone until in a ball, the classic coxinha look. Repeat for the other one.</li>
            <li>After wrapping it, tie the mixture where the saran wrap meets the bone with butcher's twine.</li>
            <li>Trim the excess saran wrap off, then sit them each in a separate rounded bowl about the same size as the bone and meat mixture. (that way they stay rounded)</li>
            <li>Stand them upright with the bone pointed up, and freeze them for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style=" width: 540px;">
            <h3>The Dough</h3>
            <li>In a large sauce pan over medium high heat add; beef broth, 1 stick of butter, creme de leite and combine until smooth.</li>
            <li>Season this mixture with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Next add your flour, there is no exact amount just until you have a nice consistency.(add slow and little by little)</li>
            <li>Your dough should not be sticking to the pan and it should not be dry.</li>
            <li>Once its combined and at the right consistency(playdoughish),. add the 2 egg yolks and combine thoroughly.(this should make a more smooth texture)</li>
            <li>On some saran wrap lay the dough and flatten it out. (divide the dough inhalf) Then take the tomahawk mixture out of the freezer and cut the saran wrap off it.</li>
            <li>next sit the tomahawk mixture in the middle of once of the flatten pieces of dough. Wrap the dough around and up the bone. (just like with the saran wrap)</li>
            <li>Trim any excess dough off.</li>
            <li>Then wrap the dough and meat mixture again with saran wrap( just like the first time), round and sit in the same bowls.</li>
            <li>Freeze them again for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Next its time to bread them!(1 flour, 2 egg-wash, 3 breadcrumbs)</li>
            <li>once breaded sit them in the bowls again.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style=" width: 540px;">
            <h3>Making it tasty</h3>
            <li>Deep fry the whole thing at 350 degrees in corn oil.(use a basket to sit them in)</li>
            <li>once fried, cook them on indirect heat until the center is done.</li>
            <li>ENJOY!</li>
        </ol>
